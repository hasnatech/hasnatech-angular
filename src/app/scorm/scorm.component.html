        <h2>What is SCORM?</h2>
        <p>SCORM, or Sharable Content Object Reference Model, is a set of technical standards for eLearning content. It
            ensures that eLearning materials can be shared and used across different Learning Management Systems (LMS)
            and platforms.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of SCORM:</h2>

            <li>
                <b>Cost-Efficiency:</b>
                <p>SCORM reduces development costs by enabling content reuse and integration of third-party content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Standardized Testing:</b>
                <p>SCORM allows for reliable administration and tracking of assessments, suitable for compliance and
